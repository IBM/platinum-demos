<summary><strong>4 - Compliance assessments</strong>: Reviewing compliance results</summary>

<br/>

| **2.1** |  |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Narration** | After gaining the environmental context from the **Arena View**, the compliance manager may determine that this compliance assessment is critical to address immediately. To further investigate, they navigate to the compliance dimension page to view the assessment details. |
| **Action** &nbsp; 2.1.1 | Click **Dimensions** (1) and select **Compliance** (2). <br/> <img src="images/2-1-1.png" width="800" /> |
| **Narration** | Compliance assessments are used by the compliance manager to evaluate whether an organization's information systems align with the security controls specified in compliance profiles. Focus Corp employs an automated compliance scanning tool that complies with NIST 800-53 standards. Popular tools in this space include OpenSCAP, Tenable.io (Nessus), Qualys, Rapid7 InsightVM, and AWS Config Rules.<br/><br/>Once a compliance scan is completed, the tool generates a report outlining the compliance status for each NIST 800-53 control. The compliance manager then uploads these assessment scans in OSCAL format to be managed and reviewed within Concert. |

<summary><strong>2 - Compliance requirements</strong>: Tuning compliance requirements to fit an organizations needs </summary>

<br/>

| **3.1** |  |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Narration** | While reviewing the compliance assessment, the compliance manager may have noticed that some of the failing controls arent specific to Focus Corps organizational needs. <br/> At Focus Corp, the organization has a mandatory requirement to follow the NIST SP 800-53 framework. While this framework is mandatory for U.S. federal agencies and contractors to protect critical data, private organizations like Focus Corp can also implement it. <br/> NIST SP 800-53 provides a comprehensive catalog of security and privacy controls related to information systems. |
| **Action** &nbsp; 3.1.1 | Click the **Catalogs** tab. <br/> <img src="images/3-1-1.png" width="800" /> |
| **Narration** | Concert handles compliance catalogs within the Compliance dimension, with NIST SP 800-53 preloaded into the platform. NIST and other compliance standards utilize the OSCAL (Open Security Controls Assessment Language) format. <br/> Examples of other standards available within IBM Concert are: <br/> **FedRAMP** (Federal Risk and Authorization Management Program) <br/> **PCI-DSS** (Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard) <br/> **SOC 2** (Service Operation Control Type 2) <br/> **CMS ARS** (CMS Acceptable Risk Safeguards) <br/><br/>The compliance manager reviews Concert’s catalog list, confirming the appropriate NIST catalog is available. <br/> If the correct catalog was missing, the compliance manager could easily add any compliance catalog standard to Concert that adheres to the OSCAL format. |
| **Action** &nbsp; 3.1.2 | Click **Upload catalog**. <br/> <img src="images/3-1-2.png" width="800" /> <br/><br/> The following **Upload catalog** screen will appear: <br/> <img src="images/3-1-3.png" width="400" /> |
| **Narration** | Since the NIST SP 800-53 catalogs come preloaded into Concert, the compliance manager does not need to import any additional catalogs at this time. |
| **Action** &nbsp; 3.1.3 | Click **Cancel**. <br/> <img src="images/3-1-4.png" width="400" /> |
| **Narration** | Next the compliance manager will ensure the compliance profile has the correct controls enabled. A compliance profile consists of a tailored set of security controls designed to meet the unique security requirements of an organization. By categorizing control baselines from compliance catalogs into profiles, Focus Corp can address their individual compliance needs more effectively. |
| **Action** &nbsp; 3.1.4 | Select the **Profiles** tab. <br/> <img src="images/3-1-5.png" width="800" /> |
| **Narration** | When a profile is selected, the compliance manager views its controls. |
| **Action** &nbsp; 3.1.5 | Click **Compliance profile**. <br/> <img src="images/3-1-6.png" width="800" /> <br/><br/> The following **Compliance profile** screen will appear: <br/> <img src="images/3-1-7.png" width="800" /> |
| **Action** &nbsp; 3.1.6 | Click **X** to close the **Compliance profile** screen. <br/> <img src="images/3-1-8.png" width="800" /> |
| **Narration** | Compliance controls are specific safeguards or practices implemented by organizations to ensure adherence to legal, regulatory, and internal standards for data protection and security. These controls help mitigate risks and enhance overall security posture. |
| **Action** &nbsp; 3.1.7 | Click **Create profile**. <br/> <img src="images/3-1-9.png" width="800" /> <br/><br/> The following **Create profile** screen will appear: <br/> <img src="images/3-1-10.png" width="800" /> |
| **Action** &nbsp; 3.1.8 | In the **Name** field, enter '**Global Profile**' (1). Select any catalog for the **Select Catalog** field (2). Select some controls in the **Select controls** field (3). <br/> <img src="images/3-1-11.png" width="800" /> |
| **Narration** | The compliance manager creates the profile by selecting the required controls from a catalog. |
| **Action** &nbsp; 3.1.9 | Click **Cancel**. <br/> <img src="images/3-1-12.png" width="800" /> |
