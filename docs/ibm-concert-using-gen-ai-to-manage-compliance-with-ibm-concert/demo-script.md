| **Narration** | The compliance manager at Focus Financial manages applications hosted across various environments. As the application portfolio has evolved, its complexity has grown. Applications now span multiple servers and cloud providers, which increases the resources needed to track and manage compliance and heightens the risk of non-compliance. Concert helps the compliance manager maintain compliance more effectively. |

| **Narration** | The operations manager is responsible for maintaining compliance by ensuring all applications adhere to regulatory requirements. By integrating compliance management into the application lifecycle, Concert streamlines compliance assessments across all applications and accelerates issue tracking.

| **Narration** | As activities occur and data is updated, Concert continuously maintains the information in the ‘Evidence store.’ The 'Evidence store' acts as a comprehensive change log, tracking CVE resolution progress, compliance status, delivered applications and all the other crucial details. <br/><br/> During software audits, compiling and presenting all necessary data to demonstrate compliance can be very time-consuming. However, with Concert, all relevant information is automatically collected and stored in the 'Evidence store,' making the audit process much more efficient. <br/><br/> For example, we can easily see what compliance assessments we’ve completed and what changed over time. |
| **Action** &nbsp; 5.1.2 | Click **Compliance assessment** under the chart. <br/> <img src="images/5-1-3.png" width="800" /> <br/><br/> The following screen will appear: <br/> <img src="images/5-1-4.png" width="800" /> |
