<summary>Introduction</summary>

In this video, we’ll show you how to ingest data into IBM Concert. 

The first part of the video will walk you through the manual process to help you understand the details of how Concert works. 

Let’s start with ingesting data manually into Concert. This is important for your understanding the different types of data and formats that Concert supports. 

For our demo, we’ll use the Quote of the Day application, which consists of 10 microservices. The final result will showcase a populated Concert Arena View with all the underlying components of the application and the prioritized CVEs.

Let’s get started.

To manually ingest data into Concert, you will need 1) The Concert Toolkit and 2) a set of helper scripts. We’ve created these helper scripts to help train you on how to use the Concert Toolkit.

In order to download the helper scripts, you’ll need to set up Github access.

<inline-notification text="If you’re logged into your IBM GitHub account in Visual Studio Code, you can download the code without a key. If you are not logged in or prefer to use a different IDE, then an SSH key pair is required to download the code."></inline-notification>
