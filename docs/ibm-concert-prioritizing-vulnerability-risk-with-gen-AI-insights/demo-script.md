<summary>Introduction</summary>

As enterprises develop and deploy an increasing number of software applications, they face significant risks and challenges related to Common Vulnerability Exposures (CVEs) and other vulnerabilities in open-source software. The traditional approach to vulnerability management often means prolonged exposure, with mitigation taking weeks and increasing the risk of breaches.

IBM Concert leverages data from various tools, empowering IT operations along with security professionals to gain a comprehensive view of vulnerabilities across their application landscape. Through its advanced gen AI engine, Concert tailors vulnerability risk assessments to each customer's unique environment, identifying potential threats, evaluating their impact, and providing actionable recommendations that reduce mean time to resolution (MTTR) from weeks to just days. This shift not only frees up person-hours but significantly lowers the risk of breaches by enabling faster, prioritized mitigation.

Let’s see how IBM Concert accelerates vulnerability management, saves time, reduces MTTR, and strengthens a company's security posture in real time.
