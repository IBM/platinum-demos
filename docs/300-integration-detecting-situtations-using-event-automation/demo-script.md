<summary>Introduction</summary>

Today we’ll see how IBM’s event automation capabilities are used to detect and react to situations to drive more revenue.

Using a fictional online retailer called Focus Corp, we’ll show how they can grow their revenue from first time customers. marketing team want to send a high-value promotion to first-time customers immediately after a large initial order. 

We’re using a retail example, but the same technology can be applied to many scenarios across your enterprise.

Let’s get started!

<summary>Summary</summary>

<br/>

In this demo we showed how Focus Corps used IBM Event Automation to capitalize on time-sensitive revenue opportunities. Specifically, we looked at how the Event catalog allows consumers to discover and subscribe to events. The marketing team used these streams to build an event processing flow. The flow detects in real-time which customers should receive the high value discount. This has transformed how quickly the marketing team can create new features and freed them up from requesting this from other teams.

Thank you for attending today’s presentation.
