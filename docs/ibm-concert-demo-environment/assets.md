- **Purpose**: This environment is only for demos and self-education. It should not be used for PoCs.
- **Workflows**: You are free to create your own workflows in this environment, but please only put them in the 'Workflows sandbox' folder. Because this is a shared environment, workflows in any other location will be deleted.
- **Ticketing**: This environment is connected to GitHub. While we ask you to not make other changes to the environment, creating tickets is permitted. <br/> - To create tickets, use the *ibm-concert-platinum-demos* organization and *concert-tickets* repository.
