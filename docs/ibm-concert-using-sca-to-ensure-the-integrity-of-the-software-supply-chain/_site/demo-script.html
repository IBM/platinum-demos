  <summary>Introduction</summary>

  <p>Today, we’ll explore how IBM Concert empowers both Security teams and DevOps engineers to accelerate Software Composition Analysis (SCA) and manage the risks associated with open-source and third-party libraries. We’ll see how Concert seamlessly integrates SCA into the application lifecycle, ensuring continuous visibility and proactive management of vulnerabilities and license risks throughout development and deployment.</p>

  <p>By continuously assessing open-source components, Concert identifies outdated or vulnerable libraries and provides prioritized recommendations to address these issues. Additionally, Concert automates the detection of license violations, malicious maintainers, and other security risks, simplifying the process of securing applications while reducing the burden on both security and DevOps teams.</p>

While it scores high in critical categories like Binary-Artifacts, Dangerous-Workflow, License, and Vulnerabilities, securing perfect 10s in these areas, it falls short in development practices like Branch-Protection and Code-Review. These gaps lower the overall score and highlight the need for better development safeguards. The recommendation is clear: by addressing these weaknesses, the package can become more robust and secure for production use. <br /><br /> Diving deeper into the reliability score, the gaps in development practices become more apparent. The lack of branch protection, with a score of 0/10, means risky, unreviewed changes could be merged, while the minimal code review process, scoring just 3/10, leaves room for undetected issues. Additionally, dependencies aren’t pinned to specific versions, adding further risk of introducing unexpected or breaking changes. By focusing on strengthening these areas, the team can significantly enhance the package’s overall reliability, ensuring it’s better prepared for production while building on its existing security strengths.</td>
