<summary>Introduction</summary>

Today we will see how Focus Corp, an online retailer, uses real-time data to capitalize on time-sensitive revenue opportunities.

Focus Corp has a goal of driving more revenue from its first-time customers. The marketing team wants to send a high-value promotion to first-time customers immediately after those customers place a large initial order.

Focus Corp's integration team use IBM Event Automation to expose event streams they believe will be useful to other teams in the company. They publish documentation of the event streams to an Event Catalog that allows non-technical consumers, like the marketing team, to discover and subscribe to the streams. The marketing team will use these event streams to precisely identify when, and to which customers, to send its highest-value promotional offers.

Let’s get started!

<summary>Summary</summary>

In this demo we showed how Focus Corp used IBM Event Automation to capitalize on time-sensitive revenue opportunities. Specifically, we saw the integration team publish event streams to an Event Catalog that allowed non-technical consumers, like the marketing team, to easily discover and subscribe to the streams. The marketing team then used these streams to build an event processing flow, using a no-code editor. The flow detects in real-time which customers should receive the highest value discounts. This has transformed how quickly the marketing team can create new features and frees them from needing to rely on the integration team for access to this valuable business data.
