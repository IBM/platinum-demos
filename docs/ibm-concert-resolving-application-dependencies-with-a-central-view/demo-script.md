<summary>Introduction</summary>

Focus Corp is preparing for a significant release of their finance application. Since financial applications are mission-critical to their customers, it's essential to ensure the software is thoroughly protected against risks before launch.

In this demo, we'll showcase an application-centric approach, demonstrating how Concert can assist in addressing CVEs, outdated packages, expired certificates, and compliance assessments.

Let's get started!

<summary><strong>2 - Vulnerabilties </strong>: Viewing a summary of vulnerabilities present in an application </summary>

<br/>

| **2.1** | **Placeholder** |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Narration** | Focus Corp requires that all Priority 1 CVEs be resolved prior to an application's release. The software developer's first goal is to assess any CVEs impacting the Finance Application. |
| **Action** &nbsp; 2.1.1 | Click the **Vulnerabilities** tab <br/> <img src="images/2-1-1.png" width="800" /> <br/> <img src="images/2-1-2.png" width="800" />|
| **Narration** | This **Vulnerabilities** page provides a comprehensive overview of both image and code scan results related to the Finance application. <br/> At the top of the page, the software developer is met with a section containing a standard description about the CVE. This description is usually provided by the security scanning tool which detected this CVE. <br/> <img src="images/2-1-3.png" width="800" /> <br/> The **Impact View** enables software developers to evaluate the criticality of a CVE by showing the environments and access points where the CVE might be exposed. Additionally, it helps pinpoint the source of the CVE by identifying the affected packages and the images where the CVE is present. <br/> <img src="images/2-1-4.png" width="800" />  <br/> The central **Findings** table represents a list of each image within the Finance application where the CVE was located. This table also allows the developer to set an assessment state and open a ticket for each image to resolve the CVE. <br/> <img src="images/2-1-5.png" width="800" /> <br/> The 2 columns at the end of the page provide additional details and recommended mitigation for the CVE. This information is provided by watsonx.ai <br/> <img src="images/2-1-6.png" width="800" /> |

<summary><strong>4 - Certificates</strong>: Using Concert Workflows to refresh environment certificates</summary>

<br/>

| **4.1** | **Placeholder** |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Narration** | Before the upcoming release, the software developer plans to rotate any expired certificates to ensure customers are not affected by potential outages. |
| **Action** &nbsp; 4.1.1 | Click on the Environments tab. <br/> <img src="images/4-1-1.png" width="800" /> <br/> <img src="images/4-1-2.png" width="800" /> <br/> On the table which appears, click on the **Certificates** tab. <br/> <img src="images/4-1-3.png" width="800" /> |
| **Narration** | The software developer gains information on the expiry status of all certificates relating to their application for a given environment. In an environment with real data, there could be hundreds of upcoming certificate expiries, or already expired certificates. So the software developer decides to set an **automation rule** within Concert to rotate all certificates for a given environment. |
| **Action** &nbsp; 4.1.2 | Click **Administration** (1) and select **Integrations** (2). <br/> <img src="images/4-1-4.png" width="800" /> <br/><br/> The following **Integrations** screen will appear: <br/> <img src="images/4-1-5.png" width="800" />  <br/> Click on the **Automation rules** tab.  <br/>  <img src="images/4-1-6.png" width="800" />  <br/> Then click on the Blue **Create Automation Rule** button. |
| **Action** &nbsp; 4.1.3 | Fill in the name and details for a new automation rule. Then change the **When this condition occurs** dropwdown to Certificate expiry. Set **take this action** to Trigger a workflow. Click the create button <br/> <img src="images/4-1-7.png" width="800" /> |
| **Narration** | One of the most valuable features of IBM Concert, in terms of Certificates, is the ability to create automation rules that automatically rotate certificates approaching expiration. These rules can be configured with specific conditions, such as the environments affected by the certificateâ€™s expiry and the number of days before expiration that should trigger the rule. By automating this process, customers can significantly reduce downtime and avoid potential disruptions across their environments.  |
